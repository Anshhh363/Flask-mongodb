i have created this flask-mongodb CRUD application as a project

I used Flask for backend scripting and MongoDB as my database. for the connectivity i have used Flask-PyMongo
library
I have also used pydantic for data validation so that no wrong data is ever entered in the database,the
password entered are also hashed and then entered in the database for user's privacy protection,
used for hashing are bcrypt and passlib

Setup Process-
local setup-To set up the application locally
1.create a virtual python environment and install all the dependencies from requirements.txt
2.next in the main.py file uncomment the uri for local setup and comment the uri for docker setup
3.now run the python file from virtual environment activated terminal by "python main.py"

docker setup-To set up from docker
1.first make sure that the Mongo-uri for docker is uncommented and Mongo-uri for local setup is commented
2.next run "docker-compose up -d" in the terminal, this should pull latest mongo and mongoexpress images from docker hub and should also build images for mongo,mongoexpress and flask CRUD application and run it
